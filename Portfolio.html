                                    Fire360 is a VR Firefighter Command Simulation. The goal of the application is to help firefighters-in-training reinforce procedural behaviors 
                                    to then use on the job. The firefighters are then guided by a trainer throughout the simulation through various kinds of obstacles. This 
                                    version of Fire360 takes place in a virtual environment that represents a single story residence and multi-story apartment complex in Miami. Below are the capabilities of the simulation:

                                    The simulation contains 12 Crews of Firefighters assigned to a vehicle. Vehicles are made up of 1 command, 4 engines, 3 quint, and 4 rescue 
                                    vehicles. The trainer can assign tasks to these NPC Crews according to the commands sent from the “Tactical” or the first firefighter to show 
                                    up to the scene of a fire. The tasks they are able to do are as follows:

                                    I worked for 3 years on this project going working on fixing the single story residence simulation to implementing new mechanics in the multi-story complex simulation. I worked on almost every aspect from creating models using photogrammetry to the implementing the fire and smoke system which was a combination of programming, vfx, audio, and animation. It was a really great experience and I will always be grateful for Steven Luis from Florida International University who gave me the opportunity to start developing my skills at the I-CAVE where my passion for developing virtual reality applications was able to grow.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

                                    What is “Community”? This is the central question of this VR experience proposed by FIU CARTA. In fact, it’s many things, including an 
                                    opportunity for student growth, faculty research, and an exploration of the future of higher education and looking at ways in which our 
                                    species approaches the environment and interpersonal connections, and develops and assessed human agency and behaviors by reflecting on the 
                                    4C’s: Creativity, Collaboration, Critical Thinking, and Communication.
FYE, First Year Experience Community VR is an application developed with Unreal Engine. The team was able to create a virtual environment representing the everglades. In this environment students have 15 minutes to create a structure using a limited number snapping blocks before the timer runs out. The goal is to practice the 4C’s and to analyze how it helped the process in creating their custom structure.<br><br>For this project, I worked on many different aspects of the production pipeline. This project was a bit different than the others here since I was Project Lead and met with the product owners and planned with the development team in order to deliver meaningful goals every sprint. I worked with Maria Constantini to plan the logistics of user testing during the COVID-19 Pandemic in which we had to take every precaution to make sure it was a sterile experience throughout. I also helped develop this program with Edward Gonzalez on mechanics, UI, and networking.</p>

                                <p class="mbr-fonts-style mbr-regular mbr-text panel-text display-7">This project was contracted to us by Unity College. We are noticing that there are more universities that are started to enhance their curriculum with virtual courses and sometimes virtual activities or assignments. Virtual Forest was made for students in the field of conservation. The application lets these students step into a day in the life of a conservation scientist where they would enter a virtual deciduous forest equipped with a laser rangefinder. The student will then locate and count a specific species and use that information to estimate that species population. Our goal in this project was to do everything possible to make it run on the lowest spec possible and levels in between. <br><br>The project was already made but it was up to a team of two (Edward and I) to analyze the project and research the best tools to optimize all aspects and then deploy it in a way where mac and PC users of all kinds can all enjoy a consistently smooth experience. Using tools like MeshCombine, NatureRenderer, and our own custom scripts we were able to optimize to the point were we had a surface pro 4 running 120fps running on Vulkan. We debugged the entire simulation from analyzing frametimes and modifying the rendering pipeline accordingly to taking all scripts running on every frame and calling them when needed. It definitely one of the funs projects I've worked on.</p>

                                    A business investor funded this project. This one allowed me to test the limits of the Oculus Quest's native tracking hardware. Using VR Expansion Plugin and Antilatency hardware, the team developed a prototype application using Unreal Engine. We provided extensive reports on the margin of error within a mm and provided realtime solutions to mitigate drift in-game. Although we cannot discuss much further since it's a private IP, I can say that it was really interesting finding out how much we can push the quest's hardware. Although its just a&nbsp;Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor with 4GB of RAM, it is capable of awesomeness!!</p>

                                    This project was contracted to us by Helms Systems. Using Unreal Engine, Soulkeeper VR sets out to be an ambitious VR RPG. To this day, it will live as one of my favorite projects simply because everything we did was driven by a simple goal. That goal was for the user to have the best experience within each action. There's very few projects where developers can take their time and develop mechanics through the journey of trial and error. I was brought onboard after the first early access release and the team was looking to overhaul every aspect of the game. I had the honor of animating the player's hands and hand poses for the objects the player picked up (before we had automatic hand IK posing lol). I also worked on the AI of wildlife and farm animals. Additionally, I worked on optimizing the visual effects. I have always been a generalist when I work in these projects because I usually find myself in short handed teams. It is within these teams, that the original vision stays anchored and I had the pleasure of working with very talented people whom I learned from.&nbsp;</p>
